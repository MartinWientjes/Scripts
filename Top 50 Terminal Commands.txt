Default Top 50 Terminal Commands
1) 2D Dock
This quite a popular hack for the people running Leopard and don’t like the 3D feel. It changes the 3D dock to a flat 2D version. To enter copy and past the following code.

killall Dock

3) Add A Message To The Login Window
This little Terminal command enables you to add a message of your choice to the Login window. Pretty cool and deserved a screenshot if I new how to take on while not logged in. Warning it’s a sudo command which can be dangerous.
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText "Your Message"
Replace “Your Message” with the message of your choice, don’t make it to long. If you want to revert it do the following.
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText ""

killall Finder

A lot of the files in Finder are hidden. This is probably a wise choice by Apple as there are countless things you can screw up. But if you want to take a look at how many there are and what they are you can show them within Finder. Be careful as these files are needed by the system, if you screw something up don’t come complaining. Repeat the command with false to revert.
